Original project was made 4 years ago, as highschooles and as a university Student now thats all in for coding and making new projects, 
I Elpida Kyriakopoulou decided to pick up what was left and make a few changes on what we started 4 years ago 
in a very interesting project when i didnt know i was going to pick this subject as a major. I altered the original website, changed the style,
deleted the links that were not working , added a map with the shelters and added icons for a more user friendly display of information.
